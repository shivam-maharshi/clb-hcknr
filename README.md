# Docker-Rkt
This is a detailed comparative study that provides quantitative and qualitative assessment of supported functionality, performance and container clustering extend of two state-of-the-art app container technologies - Docker and Rkt. 
In this project we answer questions like:

* What are the performance implications on Network, CPU and IO when running Docker versus rkt? 
* How do these ACs behave in distributed big data processing? 
* How do distributed web applications perform when containerized? 
* Which of the two ACs should be preferred for software development, for a given set of requirements? T
* To avoid a vendor lock-in, which of the two ACs must be chosen and why? 
* Performing customizations and implementing additional support is easier in which one of the two ACs? 
* How do these technologies compare in distributed environments? 
* What is the overall support by popular cloud providers? What solutions are available for container clustering and scheduling?
