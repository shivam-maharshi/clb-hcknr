Maine Pyar Kiya was later dubbed in English as ''When Love Calls'', a 125-minute version, was the biggest hit in the Caribbean market at [[Guyana]] and also dominated the box-office collections in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. ''Maine Pyar Kiya'' had also been dubbed in Spanish as ''Te Amo'', the first experiment of its kind. This 125-minute film also proved its universal appeal with a glorious 10-week premiere run at [[Lima]], capital of [[Peru]].

==Acting style and analysis==
He is one of the most commercially successful movie stars of India. While reviewing his performance in ''[[Tere Naam]]'', [[Taran Adarsh]] wrote, &quot;Salman Khan is exceptional in a role that fits him to the T. He breathes fire in sequences that demand uneasiness. But beneath the tough exterior lies a vulnerable person and this facet in particular comes to the fore in the latter reels. His emotional outbursts are splendid...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adarsh, Taran&quot;/&gt;
Adarsh also remarked that &quot;''[[Wanted (2009 film)|Wanted]]'' that it will run only on Salman's star power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wanted: Movie Review by Taran Adarsh|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/review/13476/index.html|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Filmfare]]'' commenting about him says that &quot;When it comes to a Salman Khan or a Rajnikant film, their performance is not important. It’s the audience performance that counts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ready Review|url=http://www.filmfare.com/articles/ready-2455.html|publisher=[[Filmfare]]|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received rave reviews for his portrayal of colorful cop Chulbul Pandey a.k.a. Robinhood Pandey in ''[[Dabangg]]''. Anupama Chopra of NDTV said, &quot;It's the role of a lifetime and Salman Khan bites into it like a starving man devours a feast. He inhabits it fully, strutting and swaggering and even, spoofing himself.&quot; He has thus established himself as one of the leading actors in Hindi cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/SALMAN-KHAN-Hail-Bollywood-s-new-king/Article1-920785.aspx |title=SALMAN KHAN: Hail Bollywood's new king |work=Hindustan Times |date=28 August 2012 |accessdate=3 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130113093151/http://www.hindustantimes.com:80/Entertainment/Bollywood/SALMAN-KHAN-Hail-Bollywood-s-new-king/Article1-920785.aspx |archivedate=13 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, he was voted no.3 &quot;India's Greatest Actor&quot; in [[NDTV]] poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indicine.com/movies/bollywood/top-5-greatest-actors-of-all-time-ndtv/ | title=Top 5 Greatest actors of all time | publisher=Indicine | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Khan has been the subject of several controversies, including certain legal troubles.

===Hit-and-run case===
On 28 September 2002, Khan was arrested for rash and negligent driving after his car ran into a bakery in Mumbai; one person who was sleeping on the pavement outside the bakery died and three others were injured in the mishap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/sep/28khan.htm|title=Salman Khan's jeep runs over pavement dwellers, one dead; actor surrenders|publisher=Rediff|date=28 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges of [[culpable homicide]] were laid against him, but later dropped.&lt;ref name=bbcsouthasia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3076990.stm|title=Bollywood homicide charge dropped|publisher=BBC News South Asia|date=3 September 2003|accessdate=16 October 2006|first=Zubair|last=Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July 2013, he was formally charged with culpable homicide in the case, to which he pleaded not guilty.

On 6 May 2015, Khan was found guilty of all charges in the case. The Bombay [[Sessions Court]] concluded that Salman Khan was driving the car under the influence of alcohol causing the death of one and serious injury to four homeless persons. Sessions judge DW Deshpande convicted the actor for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced him to five years in prison. Later on same day, Salman Khan, being represented by Senior Counsel Amit Desai was granted [[bail]] by the [[Bombay High Court]] till 8 May 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32603596 | publisher=BBC News | title=Salman Khan: Bollywood star guilty in hit-and-run case | date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/live-salman-khan-reaches-home-after-hc-grants-him-bail-in-2002-hitandrun-case/543984-3.html |title=Live: Salman Khan reaches home after HC grants him bail in 2002 hit-and-run case |date=6 May 2015 |work=[[CNN-IBN|IBN Live]] |accessdate=6 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20150509001751/http://ibnlive.in.com:80/news/live-salman-khan-reaches-home-after-hc-grants-him-bail-in-2002-hitandrun-case/543984-3.html |archivedate=9 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://onelawstreet.com/2015/05/read-order-salman-khan-granted-interim-bail-by-bombay-high-court-in-2002-hit-and-run-case/|title = [READ ORDER] Salman Khan granted interim bail by Bombay High Court in 2002 hit-and-run case.|last = |first = |date = 6 May 2015|work = 1, Law Street|access-date = 6 May 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; on which the court suspended his prison sentence until the final appeal hearing in July.&lt;ref&gt;The Hindustan Times, 8 May, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Salman Khan: Court suspends Bollywood star's sentence|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-32651137|accessdate=8 May 2015|work=BBC News|date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://onelawstreet.com/2015/05/read-order-bombay-high-court-suspends-sentence-and-grants-bail-to-salman-khan/|title = Read Order&amp;nbsp;– Bombay High Court suspends sentence and grants bail to Salman Khan|date = 8 May 2015|accessdate = 8 May 2015|website = 1, Law Street}}&lt;/ref&gt; His driver Ashok Singh, who had given the testimony that it was him who was driving the car at the time of accident, was charged with perjury for misguiding the Court with false testimony and was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/salman-khans-driver-ashok-singh-arrested-for-misleading-the-court-in-2002-hit-and-run-case/|title=Salman Khan's driver Ashok Singh arrested for misleading the court in 2002 hit-and-run case|work=bollywoodlife.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnapping and eventual death of prime witness Police Constable [[Ravindra Patil]] remains a mystery, with some suspecting the involvement of organised crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/the-tragic-case-of-police-constable-ravindra-patil-who-stood-against-salman-khan-in-the-2002-hit-and-run-case/|title=The tragic case of police constable Ravindra Patil who stood against Salman Khan in the 2002 hit and run case!|work=bollywoodlife.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-will-ravindra-patil-get-justice-2083880|title=Salman Hit &amp; Run Case: Will Ravindra Patil get justice?|work=dna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/news/underworld-rules-in-bollywood-1374278.html|title=Underworld rules in bollywood&amp;nbsp;— daily.bhaskar.com|work=daily.bhaskar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/newswallah-bollywood-and-organized-crime/?_r=0|title=Log In - The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Khan was acquitted of all charges from this case, due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Salman-Khan-acquitted-in-2002-hit-and-run-case-breaks-down-in-court-after-hearing-the-verdict/articleshow/50122665.cms?|title=Salman Khan acquitted in 2002 hit-and-run case, breaks down in court after hearing the verdict|work=The Times of India|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/cant-convict-salman-khan-based-on-current-evidence-says-court-1253269|title=Can't Convict Salman Khan Based on Current Evidence, Says Court|last=Ghosh|first=Deepshikha|publisher=NDTV|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Aishwarya Rai===
His relationship with actress [[Aishwarya Rai]] was a well publicized topic in the Indian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020303/spectrum/main6.htm|title=Salman in news for the wrong reasons|work=Tribune of India|date=3 March 2002|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20131121110907/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020303/spectrum/main6.htm|archivedate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their break-up in March 2002, Rai accused him of harassing her. She claimed that Khan had not been able to come to terms with their break-up and was hounding her; her parents lodged a complaint against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-09-27/news-interviews/27299504_1_atul-agnihotri-salman-khan-aishwarya-rai|title=Salman harassing me, says Aishwarya|work=The Times of India|date=27 September 2002|first1=Afsana|last1=Ahmed|first2=Smrity|last2=Sharma}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, news outlets released what was said to be an illicit copy of a mobile phone call recorded in 2001 by the Mumbai police. It appeared to be a call in which he threatened Rai, in an effort to force her to appear at social events held by Mumbai crime figures. The call featured boasts of connections to organised crime and derogatory comments about other actors. However, the alleged tape was tested in the [[Indian Government|government's]] Forensic lab in [[Chandigarh]], which concluded that it was fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050718/nation.htm#1|title=Police records Salman Khan's voice, Ash keeps mum|work=The Tribune|date=18 July 2005|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20131121110907/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050718/nation.htm#1|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20131121110907/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020303/spectrum/main6.htm|archivedate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salman cleared in Aishwarya tape case|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2005/09/17/int6.htm|work=Dawn|accessdate=17 September 2005}}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five star hotels and stuff. So they panicked. Then they got up and spoke about it. My question is why not before. Attacks have happened in trains and small towns too, but no one talked about it so much.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ExpressSalman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesSalman&quot;/&gt; Khan also said that [[Pakistan]] was not to be blamed for it, and that the Indian security forces had failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtubevideosalman&quot;&gt;{{YouTube|sRE_JPshpvU|NewsVideo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan's comments had drawn strong reactions from Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra Chagan Bhujbal, Shiv Sena, BJP and other political parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;ExpressIndia&quot;&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Salman-causes-uproar-with-Mumbai-attack-comment-aplologises/680675/ Salman causes uproar with Mumbai attack comment, aplologises]{{Dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments were also condemned by Ujwal Nikam, Special Prosecutor in the 26/11 trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;ExpressIndia&quot;/&gt; Khan later apologized for his comments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ExpressSalman&quot;/&gt;
